# Incident Response Guide

This guide outlines best practices for establishing a robust Incident Response (IR) plan to effectively detect, respond, and recover from cybersecurity incidents. It is designed to minimize downtime, protect sensitive information, and ensure business continuity.

## Phases of Incident Response:
1. **Preparation**:
    - Develop and maintain an IR policy and communication plan.
    - Train employees on incident response roles and responsibilities.
    - Implement monitoring tools (e.g., SIEM) to detect potential threats.
    
2. **Identification**:
    - Use automated tools (e.g., Splunk, IBM QRadar) to detect anomalies.
    - Analyze logs and threat intelligence to confirm the incident.
    
3. **Containment**:
    - Isolate the affected systems to prevent the spread of the attack.
    - For cloud environments, leverage segmentation and virtual firewalls.
    
4. **Eradication**:
    - Remove malicious files and patch vulnerabilities.
    - Collaborate with legal and compliance teams to ensure regulatory requirements are met.
    
5. **Recovery**:
    - Restore systems from clean backups.
    - Monitor for signs of reinfection or persistence.
    
6. **Lessons Learned**:
    - Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify gaps and improvements.
    - Update IR policies and conduct a new risk assessment.

**Tools Recommended**: Splunk, QRadar, AWS CloudTrail, Microsoft Sentinel.
